The following describes the data on which the CNNs in this folder were trained:

1.  This CNN was trained on all classes 0-9 of the MNIST dataset.
2.  This CNN was trained on images of 1's from the MNIST dataset, and images of noise.  The noise images were generated by creating images where each pixel value has a 50% chance of being black or white.
3.  This CNN was trained on images of 1's from the MNIST dataset, and plain black images.
4.  This CNN was trained on images of 1's from the MNIST dataset, and images of noise.  The noise images were created by choosing 5% of the pixels, and shading those and all adjacent pixels white.
5.  This CNN was trained on images of 1's from the MNIST dataset, and images of noise.  The noise images were created by choosing 1% of the pixels, and shading those and all adjacent pixels white.
6.  This CNN was created on images of 1's from the MNIST dataset, and images of those same 1's with their colors inverted.
7.  This CNN was created on images of a single 1 from the MNIST dataset, and images of that 1 with the colors inverted.
